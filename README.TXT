 🎲 Number Guessing Game (Java)

A simple **Guess the Number** game written in Java.  
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.  
After each guess, the program gives a hint whether the guess is too high or too low, until the user guesses correctly.

🚀 How It Works
1. The game generates a random number between **1–100**.
2. The user enters a guess.
3. The program checks:
   - ✅ If the guess is correct → The game ends and shows number of attempts.
   - 🔼 If the guess is too high → Asks the user to try again.
   - 🔽 If the guess is too low → Asks the user to try again.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
